This is a short Document about waze shortest path problem.
in this project we will try to write a little piece of code to try and solved this issue the best we can.


*we searched for a good enough open source that claim  to solve the problem.
*after we found a code on www.geeksforgeeks.org, we downloaded it and tried to figure out what is the main idea behind it.
when we understand that we are to dumb to figure it out we decided to trust the person who worth it and move on!
just one thing we did manage to do is test it out and see that it's working pretty good.
